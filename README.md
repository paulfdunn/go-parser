# go-parser
Go-parser was written to support parsing of log files that were written for human consumption and are generally difficult to parse.

Features:
* Reading data - Supports reading from a file or directly from an from an io.Reader. Data and errors are returned via channels, allowing multi-threading. Data is returned via a channel, making iterating easy.
* Replacement - Supports direct replacement using regular expressions. This feature can be used to replace string lacking delimiters with strings that have delimiters, or for any other replacement purposes.
* Filtering - Supports both positive (line of data must match) and negative (line of data cannot match) filtering of data.
* Extraction - Supports "extraction". I.E. finding fields that match a regular expression, removing matches from input, and returning matches as an additional field. The main utility of extraction is when used with hashing to identify distinct row types. 
* Hashing - After extracting values from field(s) (columns of data), hash the field(s) in order to allow pareto analysis. I.E. If the input has two rows with a given field containing `some critical event flag=1` and `some critical event flag=2`, you may really only want to know how many events occured with `some critical event flag`. By extracting the `flag` value and hashing the result, those two fields are now the same and a pareto can be built on hashes. Keep a map[hash]field so you can decode the hashes back to something meaningful.
